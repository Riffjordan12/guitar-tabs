Itsuki No Komoriuta (Lullaby of Itsuki)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
The song, "Itsuki No Komoriuta" tells of a time of big poverty and hardships in Japan's history. It relates the singer's difficulties and her hopes that the baby will be separate from them and sleep in peace. The lullaby is nearly 400 years old. It comes from Itsuki, which is present day Kumamoto, on the Southern island of Kyushu. A song sung by a servant; she is waiting for the bon* festival when she will be able to go back to her own village.

Itsuki No Komoriuta
 
1) I stay until a Bon after that I´ll take my leave.
If "bon" comes earlier, I leave here the sooner. 
I´am poor like a beggar.
You people are good peoples with good Obi** and good Kimonos on. 
 
2) As for me, If I should die, who would weep over me? 
Only cicadas sing among the pines on the hill. 
No, not cicadas, but the sister will cry.
Oh, Sister, don´t cry as it hurts me.

3)  
If I die bury me by the roadside, every passerby may offer flowers. 
The Flowers will be Camellias, Water may come down from the heavens.
